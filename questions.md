# Data Structure & Algorithms

## Data structure Concepts

1. Write a function that receives marks scored by a student in 3 subjects and returns the average and percentage of these marks. Use call by value and call by reference concept to call this function from main () and print the results in main ().

2. Write a function to compute the distance between two points and use it to develop another function that will compute the area of the triangle whose vertices are A(x1,y1),B(x2,y2), and C(x3,y3).Use these functions to develop a function which returns a value 1 if the point (x,y) lies inside the triangle ABC, otherwise a value 0.
